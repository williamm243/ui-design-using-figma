# ui-design-using-figma
As part of my prgressive need and urge to learn i grew interest in ui design which is basically a beautifull way to create user interface design(prototypes).
I took a course in udemy on figma and ui design, I also did research on youtube and online
it was a challenging course that took me a lot of time to study, learn, comprehend and master.
i did a lot of practice  and a lot of projects to gain confidence and mastery.
i know i am a work in progress but here is a project that i loved and enjoyed doing.

*Prototypes to a juice shop app*

This design focuses on an app prototype of a juice vendor or shop  it is a simple design for users to interact with a shop and buy  a drink
